# COMP0113 Virtual Environments

- **Immersion** is a description of the technology

  - inclusive, extensive, surrounding, vivid, egocentric, plot, proprioceptive match

- **Virtualization** is the process by which the user interprets patterned sensory impression (to represent object ) from the virtual environments rather than where the impression originated.

  - **Virtual Space** is the process where user perceives a three-dimensional layout of objects in space when viewing a flat surface presenting pictorial cues such as **perspective 透视, shading 着色, occlusion 阻挡 and texture gradient 纹理渐变**, and perceived size or scale is not intrinsically defined in the virtual space.
  - **Virtual Image** is a perception of objects in depth where **accommodative 调节, vergence 收敛 and optionally stereoscopic disparity cues 立体视差线索** are presents, though not necessarily consistent. The actual perceptual scaling of the constructed space is not arbitrary, but not related to viewing geometry.
  - **Virtual Environment** additionally has **observer-slaved motion parallax 运动视差, depth-of-focus 焦深, and wide field-of-view without prominent frame 无边框视场**. These features can consistently synthesized to provide physiological reflexes such as accommodative vergence and  vestibular ocular reflex (调节性辐辏和前庭眼反射).

- **Presence**

  - Place Illusion (PI): The illusion of being in rendered virtual place. (environments looks real) (programmable)
    - real-world sensorimotor contingencies.
  - Plausibility Illusion (Psi): The illusion that what is happening is real. (environments acts real) (programmable)
    - events respond to actions and relate personally, situation is coherent with expectations.
  - Response As If Real (RAIR): physiological, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive

  *programmable*: can be determined by physical and computational properties of the VR system.

  - difficulties: 
    - What is plausible depends on user knowledge.
    - Easy to be implausible, cup break in wrong sound, floating object, person not interacting...

### Embodiment 体现 & Cognition 认知

A key part of plausibility illusion is whether you see yourself, for example, participants in the pit experiment have stronger reaction if they see their own body, also shown in the rubber hand experiment that if a fake hand matches visually and sensational, user will thought that is their real hand in the virtual place; another experiment also shows that if a lamb falls onto the virtual hand, the user will have stress response (Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)), and it does not matter if the hand is drifted slightly out of place over time.
