## COMP0023 Perception and Interface

- office hours Tuesday 5-6pm: https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=3312817

Every week, I will update the following components of the module:

- recorded lectures, which include the bulk of the technical material for the module: new recordings will be released every Monday on Moodle.
- slides corresponding to the recordings on the calendar page of the class Web site (http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Vissicchio/comp0023/calendar.html)
- problem sets, that are not assessed courseworks on the corresponding week’s topics: they are also released on Mondays but on the Web site of the module (i.e., http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Vissicchio/comp0023/cw.html).
- optional drop-in sessions on Tuesdays, which I intend to use as office hours, i.e., for 1:1 questions and answers on the content of the module: the Zoom link for participating in any of those sessions is posted on Moodle.
- plenary sessions on Fridays. I plan to use them for collective discussions on the content of the module, and to go through the solutions of the problem sets. Right now, I am still planning to have in-person sessions, unless something drastically changes in the meanwhile – at the national or at the personal level.

For this week

- I have released this week’s recordings on Moodle, and slides + problem sets on the class Web site
- I have setup a Zoom link for tomorrow’s office hours and post it on Moodle (under the “office hours” section)
- I plan for the next Friday session to be in-person. At the beginning of such a session, I will also go through the logistics of the module with you, so we will have a chance to clarify them in-person, and discuss them together
