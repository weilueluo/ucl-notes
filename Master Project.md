### Mihoyo

- building diverse culture, more culture elements
- character
  - unique play style, storytelling around characters
  - pipeline
    1. world settings, where character live in etc, 
    2. writers comes up with ideas for discussion, no creative director
       - gameplay, art, settings, player preferences
    3. ensure character look as good as concept in game
       - tessellation, topology, texture standards
       - model & texture
       - face dynamic lightmap
       - different rendering pipeline for individual characters
       - artificially controlled shadow effects transition
       - look good at any direction
    4. combat, movement action, gameplay design
  - real-time dynamic lit environment
  - real-time character lighting, e.g. leaves shadow cast on character when they walk under the tree
- stylized world
  - mix 8 layers at most 	
  - hacks in real world nature
    - terrain tint, grass-filling
      - randomized density
      - grass color = terrain color, but adjustable
      - mix multiple texture for different visual for different distance
    - tree are blended with environment
    - clouds growth are keyframed by artists
